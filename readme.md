Wardrobe allows the end user to store articles of clothing in a database via a web application. The user can enter an article of clothing via a button on the articles page, and input the clothing type, color, occasion, material and photo. The clothing is all displayed on the articles index page, and the user can sort by type. The pages are styled to create a cohesive black/blue theme with white text.
